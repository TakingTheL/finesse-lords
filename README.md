## Dataset: Parties in Nwe York City (2016)
This dataset contains information on noise complaints about parties throughout New York City during 2016 including coordinates and number of calls from each location.

## Explanation of project
We will cast small icons over certain locations on a New York City map, and these locations will represent the different stores in our dataset. We have numerous sources that will help us achieve this, including: https://medium.com/@andybarefoot/making-a-map-using-d3-js-8aa3637304ee. 
After the points are charted, we will make different size balls to represent the severity of the noise complaints (number of calls). This will serve as our MVP, and if we can achieve this, we will expand.


## D3 Usage
We will use a map made using d3 as well as circles as markers on each location.
